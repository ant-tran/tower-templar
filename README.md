# TowerTemplar

  To run the game, simply go to the "RunGame" folder and select the folder for Mac or Windows and download the zip project.
Next, run the .exe file for windows (or.app file for Mac).
If you'd like to look at the code, simply go to the Assets/Scripts folder.

  Instead, if you'd like to run the application in Unity you can also pull down the repo, open unity and open the 
"TowerTemplar" folder. Then open the "Assets" folder, open the "Main_Menu" scene, and click the "Start" button after it loads.
